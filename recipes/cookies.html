    <h3>10 minute Choc-Chip Cookies</h3>
    <p>
      I'm what you might call a "cookie connoisseur" — so much so that I wrote
      an entire cookbook dedicated to the subject. (It's aptly titled Cookies.)
      I've published hundreds of cookie recipes over the years and have talked
      at length about my love of the craft. But the one thing I decided to
      exclude from my cookbook is a classic, no-frills chocolate chip cookie
      recipe. Not because I don't like them, but because there are so many
      amazing chocolate chip cookie recipes already out there, I didn't think
      that creating yet another recipe would be very helpful. But baking through
      some of the most popular recipes online to pick out the best of what's
      already published? Now that's helpful — so that's exactly what I did.
