### Purpose

Simple project that's part of the Odin project. 

### Notes

- Feel very comfortable with this topic. Using it as a refresher and to build a strong foundation. 
- Great reviews of Odin project. Have had quite a few people ask me where to begin if they want to learn to code. Odin seems like a solid option but want to test it before recommending it
